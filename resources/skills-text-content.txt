Title: Your attitude determines your direction / attitudes are contagious. Make yours worth catching

skill 1: Radical open mindness 

skill 2: Thoughful disagreement

skill 3: Highly analytical approach but also soft skills to approach situations

skill 1: 
	I'm very much aware there are more things that I don't know than I know, and I firmly believe the sooner you get this point the better you confront situations when things are fucked up. I'm constantly looking for advices and ideas. There is -very often- a better way to do things right and everything has a proper solution. I don't panic to the unknown.

Skill 2:
	I think this is one of the hardest skills to get into life (and I'm still improving it). Learn to hear a different perspective even when it doesn't likes you because if you really pay attention to it, you will have a broader perspective of the situation and, therefore, make better decisions. Then you can argue if needed. 

Skill 3:
	I have always been a very analytical person, not the big deal. The cost of this is poorly social skills (I became more robot than empathic) so I decided to dedicate a lot of time -years and keep going- to became proeficient at soft skills. Today I feel very capable to understanding situations, people and trace a route taking into consideration different schemas depending of the participants without loosing the main goal.
