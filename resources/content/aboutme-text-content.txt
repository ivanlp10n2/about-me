About me:

Animal lover, bio-hack researcher and the friend who everyone ask for motivation.
I'm a self-taught developer and high social skilled person who, constantly, is looking for improving life perspective.

I decided to make this website mainly because I sucks at design and art. Yes, this is a challenge for me. 
If you find this page as something you like, it means I approved the mission. Yeah! :)

Right now I'm working as consultant on Business Intelligence. Honestly,I enjoy it a lot because of the context impact we do on things everyday.
I was previously working on web development and decided to move into BI in order to acquire a better idea of what data actually does. And I did it!

Now I take almost every free time to what I love the most: code.

I'm looking for a change and I will get it soon (I'm very self-confident).
