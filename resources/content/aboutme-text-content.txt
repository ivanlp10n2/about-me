About me:

Animal lover, bio-hack researcher and the guy who everyone ask for perspective or productivity tips.

I'm a high social skilled and self-taught developer who is constantly looking for improving his life perspective.

I took the desicion to create this website, mainly, because I sucks at design and art. So, yes, this is a big challenge for me. 
If you find this page as something you like, it means I did my job right. Yeah! 

Right now I'm working as Business Intelligence consultant and honestly, I'm enjoy it because of the business impact we have on things everyday.

I was previously working on web development and decided to move into BI in order to acquire a better idea of what data actually does. 
And I did it!

Now I take almost everytime I have to do what I love the most: code.

I'm looking for a change and I will get it soon (I'm very self-confident).
