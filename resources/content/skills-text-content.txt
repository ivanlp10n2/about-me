Title: Your attitude determines your direction / attitudes are contagious. Make yours worth catching

skill 1: Radical open mindness 

skill 2: Thoughful disagreement

skill 3: Soft and Analytical skills

skill 4: Transparency

skill 1: 
	I'm very much aware there are more things that I don't know than I know. And I firmly believe the sooner you get to this point the better you deal with situations when things are fucked up. I'm constantly looking for advices and ideas. There is -very often- a better way to do things right. I don't panic to the unknown.

Skill 2:
	This was one of the hardest skills to get into my life (and I'm still improving it). Learn to understand a different perspective even when it doesn't likes you. Because if you really pay attention to it you will have a broader perspective of the situation and, therefore, make better decisions. Only then you can argue, if needed. 

Skill 3:
	I have always been a very very analytical person but the cost of this is poorly social skills (I became more robotic than empathic) so I decided to dedicate a lot of time -years and keep going- to became proeficient at soft skills. Today I feel very capable to understanding situations, people, and trace a route taking into consideration different schemas depending on the involved participants without loosing the main goal.

Skill 4: 
	Being transparent is more than being honest, <i>it's building an honest relationship</i>. I believe transparency is not a desirable value but a must. It was hard for me because, in order to accomplish it, you must admit your limits and weakness too. I'm not afraid of telling the truth even when it is not favorable and I do my best to be as honest and direct as I can.
