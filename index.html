                        <br><br>
                        I'm a high social skilled and self-taught developer who is constantly looking to improve his work and life goals.
                        <br><br>
                        I took the desicion to create this website, mainly, because I sucks at design and art. So, yes, this is a big challenge for me. <br>
                        If you find this page as something you like, it means I did my job right. Yeah!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Right now I'm working as Business Intelligence consultant and honestly, I'm enjoying it because of the business impact we have on things everyday.
                        <br>
                        I was previously working on web development and decided to move into BI in order to acquire a better idea of what data actually does.
                        <br><br>
                        And I did it!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I take almost everytime I have to do what I love the most: code.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm looking for a change and I will get it soon (I'm very self-confident).<br>

                        <h3> Radical open mindness </h3>
                        <p> I'm very much aware there are more things that I don't know than I know. And I firmly believe the sooner you get to this point the better you deal with situations when things are fucked up. I'm constantly looking for advices and ideas. There is -very often- a better way to do things right. I don't panic to the unknown.</p>

                        <h3> Thoughful disagreement </h3>
                        <p> This was one of the hardest skills to get into my life (and I'm still improving it). Learn to understand a different perspective even when it doesn't likes you. Because if you really pay attention to it you will have a broader perspective of the situation and, therefore, make better decisions. Only then you can argue, if needed.  </p>

                        <h3> Soft and Analytical skills </h3>
                        <p>I have always been a very very analytical person but the cost of this is poorly social skills (I became more robotic than empathic) so I decided to dedicate a lot of time -years and keep going- to became proeficient at soft skills. Today I feel very capable to understanding situations, people, and trace a route taking into consideration different schemas depending on the involved participants without loosing the main goal.

                        <h3> Transparency </h3>
                        <p>Being transparent is more than being honest, <i>it's building an honest relationship</i>. I believe transparency is not a desirable value but a must. It was hard for me because, in order to accomplish it, you must admit your limits and weakness too. I'm not afraid of telling the truth even when it is not favorable and I do my best to be as honest and direct as I can.
