                        <br><br>
                        I'm a high social skilled and self-taught developer who is constantly looking to improve his work and life goals.
                        <br><br>
                        I took the desicion to create this website, mainly, because I sucks at design and art. So... yes, this is a big challenge for me. <br>
                        If you find this page as something likeable, it means I did my job right. Yeah!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Right now I'm working as Business Intelligence consultant. And, honestly, I'm enjoying it because of the impact we have on business everyday.
                        <br>
                        I was previously working on web development-quite comfy- and I took the risk of an unknown area by deciding to move into BI to get a better idea of what data actually does.
                        <br><br>
                        And I did it!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I take almost every free time I have to do what I love the most: code.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm looking for a change and I'm sure I will get it soon! (I'm very self-confident).<br>

                        <p> 
                            I'm very aware there are much more things that I don't know than I know. And, I firmly believe, the sooner you get to this point the soon you become open to new challenges. 
                            <br><br>
                            I'm constantly looking for advices and ideas. There is -very often- a better way to do things right. 
                            <br><br>
                            I don't panic to the unknown.

                        <p> 
                            This was one of the hardest skills to get into my life (and I'm still improving it). 
                            <br><br>
                            Learn to understand a different perspective even when it doesn't likes you because, if you really pay attention to it, you will have a broader perspective of the situation and, therefore, make better decisions.
                            <br><br>
                            Only then you can argue, if needed.

                        <p>
                            I have always been a very very analytical person, but the cost of this is poorly social skills (I became more robotic than empathic). <br>
                            That's why I decided to dedicate a lot of time -years and keep going- to became proeficient at soft skills. 
                            <br><br>
                            Today I feel very capable to understanding situations, people, and trace a route taking into consideration different schemas depending on the involved participants without loosing the main goal.

                        <h3 class="skill-title"> Transparency </h3>
                        <p>
                            Being transparent is more than being honest, it's building an honest relationship. 
                            <br><br>
                            I believe transparency is not a desirable value but a must. 
                            It was hard for me because I had must admit your limits and weakness too. 
                            <br><br>
                            Today I'm not afraid of telling the truth even when it is not favorable and I do my best to be as honest and direct as I can. 
                            <br><br>
                            It always pays off.

                    Q: Your website seems cool but.. What are you specialized to? </p>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    A: I have been developing on Java (Android and JavaX) as side-projects and Spring framework (Java webapp) for an airline company as consultant for near 2 years on two projects.
                    <br>
                    Also I have been working on Virtual Reality projects (Unity Engine, JavaScript and Blender) inside my job for a 1+ year. It went so good that I have been recognized as a valuable employee and sent to have an interview with the Governor of the province of Buenos Aires.
                    <br><br>
                    Today I'm working as BI consultant (Microstrategy) developing components for reporting and dashboards.
                    <br><br>
                    Last but not least I have been learning Machine Learning in DataCamp for a year on my free time. I decided to step back from here because I started to miss coding so much.

                    A: I'd love a JavaScript FullStack challenge. Right now I'm learning front-end (This webpage) and I'll go into Vue or React as soon as I refactor my other project (check github).
                    <br>
                    My goal is, someday, to become a Team Leader on my tech stack. I feel very confident in Java as my experience is positive towards it and I'd like to move to functional programming and get into JS and its thousand frameworks.

                    A: I'm Argentinian so I'm native Spanish speaker.
                    <br>
                    Also, I really love English. Almost everything I have in my own must be in English. I can speak, write and read without major problems. I feel very comfy at it.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                    A: Sure! Of course the offer must be better than what it is today (for obvious reasons) and I'll be glad to move on.
