                        <br><br>
                        I'm a high social skilled and self-taught developer who is constantly looking to improve his work and life goals.
                        <br><br>
                        I took the desicion to create this website, mainly, because I sucks at design and art. So, yes, this is a big challenge for me. <br>
                        If you find this page as something you like, it means I did my job right. Yeah!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Right now I'm working as Business Intelligence consultant and honestly, I'm enjoying it because of the business impact we have on things everyday.
                        <br>
                        I was previously working on web development and decided to move into BI in order to acquire a better idea of what data actually does.
                        <br><br>
                        And I did it!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I take almost everytime I have to do what I love the most: code.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm looking for a change and I will get it soon (I'm very self-confident).<br>

                        <h3> Radical open mindness </h3>
                        <p> I'm very much aware there are more things that I don't know than I know, and I firmly believe the sooner you get this point the better you confront situations when things are fucked up. I'm constantly looking for advices and ideas. There is -very often- a better way to do things right and everything has a proper solution. I don't panic to the unknown.</p>

                        <h3> Thoughful disagreement </h3>
                        <p> I think this is one of the hardest skills to get into life (and I'm still improving it). Learn to hear a different perspective even when it doesn't likes you because if you really pay attention to it, you will have a broader perspective of the situation and, therefore, make better decisions. Then you can argue if needed. </p>

                        <h3> Soft and Analytical skills </h3>
                        <p>I have always been a very analytical person, not the big deal. The cost of this is poorly social skills (I became more robot than empathic) so I decided to dedicate a lot of time -years and keep going- to became proeficient at soft skills. Today I feel very capable to understanding situations, people and trace a route taking into consideration different schemas depending of the participants without loosing the main goal.
