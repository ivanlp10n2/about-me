                        <br><br>
                        I'm a self-taught developer and high social skilled person who, constantly, is looking for improving life perspective.
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to make this website mainly because I sucks at design and art. Yes, this is a challenge for me. <br>
                        If you find this page as something you like, it means I accomplished well this mission. Yeah! :)<br>
                        <br>
                        Right now I'm working as consultant on Business Intelligence. Honestly,I enjoy it a lot because of the context impact we do on things everyday.<br>
                        I was previously working on web development and decided to move into BI in order to acquire a better idea of what data actually does. And I did it!<br>
                        <br>
                        Now I take almost every free time to what I love the most: code.<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm looking for a change and I will get it soon (I'm very self-confident).<br>
